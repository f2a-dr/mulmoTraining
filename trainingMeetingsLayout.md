For now three meetings are planned:

# Linux, shell, in particular bash

Tutorial hands-on, brief explanation of the commands to use and some example to test it during the meeting.

A machine to do the tutorial will be provieded to the MSc thesis students, other partecipants can use their own laptop.

## What to prepare

Kind of a guide which can be followed from future students without the need for a meeting/workshop.

## Possible topics

- Use of a terminal emulator and what is a shell
- Most common commands to navigate in a file system: ls, cd, touch, mkdir, cp, rm, echo, cat, tail, head
- Use of man: example on tail, example on grep?
- Redirection command with write and append, stdout stderr
- Maybe pipe operator `|`
- Text editors that can work on a terminal emulator: nano or vim (for who is feeling masochist)
- Package managers: apt, snap
- Permissions: read, write and execute, sudo
- Running a simple bash script
- Running a simple python script, maybe pip and modules
- Compiled languages vs scripted languages: compile and run a C++ program
- What is ssh?

# Computational resources, clusters, parallelization, SLURM

## Possible topics

- More on ssh, scp, rsync
- Why parallelize? Maybe mention the concept of scalability
- Miniclusters, HPC@Polito
- Policy for the use of shared computational resources

# git, Data management
