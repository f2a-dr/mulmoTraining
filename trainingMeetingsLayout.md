For now three meetings are planned:

# Linux, shell, in particular bash (April 5th @1400)

Tutorial hands-on, brief explanation of the commands to use and some example to test it during the meeting.

A machine to do the tutorial will be provided to the MSc thesis students, other partecipants can use their own laptop.

## What to prepare

Kind of a guide which can be followed from future students without the need for a meeting/workshop.

## Possible topics

- [x] Use of a terminal emulator and what is a shell
- [x] Most common commands to navigate in a file system: ls, cd, touch, mkdir, cp, rm, echo, cat, tail, head
- [ ] Use of man: example on tail, example on grep?
- [ ] Redirection command with write and append, stdout stderr
- [ ] Maybe pipe operator `|`
- [ ] Text editors that can work on a terminal emulator: nano or vim (for who is feeling masochist)
- [ ] Package managers: apt, snap
- [x] Permissions: read, write and execute, sudo
- [ ] Running a simple bash script
- [ ] Running a simple python script, maybe pip and modules
- [ ] Compiled languages vs scripted languages: compile and run a C++ program
- [ ] What is ssh?

# Computational resources, clusters, parallelization, SLURM (April 12th? @1530-1700?)

## Possible topics

- More on ssh, scp, rsync
- Why parallelize? Maybe mention the concept of scalability
- Miniclusters, HPC@Polito
- Policy for the use of shared computational resources

# git, Data management 
Just follow the mulmo guide, to be done in the week between Apr 12 and Apr 19 (Apr 19: mulmopro seminar, Sandro)
